			&lt;p&gt;Reasoning from the Scriptures Concerning Christ (1)                         &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bible Verses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;                       &lt;p&gt;Acts 17:2 And according to his custom Paul went in to them,  and on three Sabbaths he reasoned with them from the  Scriptures, (3) Opening and setting before them that the  Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead, and saying, This  is the Christ, the Jesus whom I announce to you.&lt;p&gt;                     &lt;b&gt;Words of Ministry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;                      &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; [Part 1 of 2] &lt;br&gt; Concerning what did Paul reason with those in the synagogue  from the Scriptures? Concerning theology and the law of  Moses? Concerning types and prophecies? No, he did not reason  from the Scriptures concerning any of these things. Rather,  he reasoned concerning Christ, &quot;opening and setting before  them that the Christ must suffer and rise from among the  dead, and saying, This is the Christ, Jesus, whom I announce  to you&quot; &lt;br&gt; [Acts 17:3] &lt;br&gt;. &lt;p&gt;When Paul was in the synagogue in Thessalonica, he did not  reason concerning the law. Rather, from the Scriptures he  reasoned with those in the synagogue concerning Christ. He  set before them that Christ must suffer and rise from among  the dead. Then he said to them, &quot;This is the Christ, Jesus,  whom I announce to you.&quot;&lt;p&gt;Because Paul was constituted of the Spirit of Jesus, he was  led, guided, and directed by this Spirit. He did not have the  heart to reason concerning genealogies, prophecies, or types.  He had just one burden, and this burden was according to his  spiritual constitution. Paul's constitution was fully of the  Spirit of Jesus. Therefore, in Thessalonica Paul ministered  nothing other than the all-inclusive Christ. Many rabbis  studied the Old Testament without seeing anything of Christ.  Paul, however, could see Christ revealed in the Scriptures. &lt;br&gt; [Continued Monday] &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;                                                           &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bible verses are taken from the Recovery Version of the Bible  and Words of Ministry, from Witness Lee, Life-study of  Acts, pp. 393-394. Both are published by Living Stream  Ministry, Anaheim, CA.&lt;/p&gt;
