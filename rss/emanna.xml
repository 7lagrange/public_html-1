			&lt;p&gt;A Lover of Christ&lt;p&gt;                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bible Verses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (RcV)                     &lt;p&gt;John 14:21 He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is  the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My  Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him.  (23) Jesus answered and said to him, If anyone loves Me, he  will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will  come to him and make an abode with him.   Song of Solomon 5:16 His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is  altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend,  O daughters of Jerusalem.&lt;p&gt;                   &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Words of Ministry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;                   &lt;p&gt;To believe in Him &lt;br&gt; [Jesus Christ] &lt;br&gt; is to receive Him, and to  love Him is to enjoy Him. We all have believed in Him. This  means that we all have received Him. But the problem today is  whether we love Him or not. Although you have received the  Lord Jesus and He is now within you, you may not love Him. We  need to be a lover of the Lord Jesus all day long. &lt;p&gt;His presence is always related to our love toward Him. The  more we love Him, the more we enjoy His presence. What is His  presence? It is simply the enjoyment of Himself. As long as  we have His presence, we enjoy Him. The more we love Him, the  more we shall have His presence. The more we are in His  presence, the more we shall enjoy all that He is to us. We  only need to love Him. Knowing means nothing; only loving  counts. How we all need to love Him! I have been loving Him  for fifty years and today I feel that He is more lovable than  ever. No one is as lovely as He is. Song of Songs says that  He is altogether lovely (5:16). &lt;p&gt;                                                        Words of Ministry taken from Witness Lee, Life-study of John  (Anaheim, CA: Living Stream Ministry, 1985), pp. 383 &lt;p&gt;Please visit us at www.emanna.com  Comments to: comment@emanna.com. &lt;/p&gt;
