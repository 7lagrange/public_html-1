			&lt;p&gt;Recover Back to the Enjoyment of Christ&lt;p&gt;                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bible Verses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;                        &lt;p&gt;Revelation 2:7 ...to him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat  of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.  2:17 ...to him who overcomes, to him I will give of the  hidden manna... 3:20  Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears  My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine  with him and he with Me.&lt;p&gt;                    &lt;b&gt;Words of Ministry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;                       &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; [In Revelation] &lt;br&gt; Christ, the Head of the Body, came in to call  the overcomers to overcome the degraded situation. The  overcomers in Revelation do not simply overcome sin, the  world, and the flesh; they especially overcome the degraded  situation in which the clear view of the all-inclusive Christ  has been lost.&lt;p&gt;The problem in today's degraded situation is that many things  are replacing the all-inclusive Christ. We need to turn from  all replacements and come back directly to the all-inclusive  Christ as our tree of life, our hidden manna, our feast, and  our everything. We need to come back to this One in the way  of enjoyment, not merely in the way of doctrine. We need to  return to Him not only in the way of knowing Him objectively,  but in the way of enjoying Him as the tree of life, the  hidden manna, and the feast.&lt;p&gt;This is a transfer out of old degraded religion into an up- to-date recovery, a recovery of the enjoyment of the all- inclusive Christ. We need to have an overall view to see  today's degraded situation and also to see that the Lord's  intention is to bring us back to Himself so that we may be  fully recovered to the enjoyment of Him. Our need today is to  experience a transfer from degraded religion to the reality  of the all-inclusive Christ in the way of enjoyment.&lt;p&gt;                                                          &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bible verses are taken from the Recovery Version of the Bible  and Words of Ministry, from Witness Lee, Life-study of  Acts, pp. 520-521. Both are published by Living Stream  Ministry, Anaheim, CA.&lt;/p&gt;
