<h1><i>Research Interest</i></h1>

We develop computational methods to study human genetics and diseases. Major areas of interest include genome sequencing and assembly, genetic mapping of complex diseases, MHC, autoimmune, and pharmacogenomics.

We study the genetics of diseases using high-throughput genomic approaches, and develop computational methods to facilitate the analysis of genomic data. 

<h2>Computational genomics</h2>

<p>Developing computational tools for the design and analysis of genomics studies. Specifically</p>

<ul>
<li>Variant calling from high-throughput sequencing: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/atlas-snp/">SNPs</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~ys2411/zinfandel/">Copy Number Variants</a> </li>
<li><em>De novo</em> assembly of whole genome shotgun reads, including genomes with high polymorphism rate, or structural variants. especially tumor genomes, where rearrangement is abundant. </li>
<li>Design issues of genome-wide resequencing for human diseases. <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~ys2411/opera/">Power calculator</a></li>
<li>Analytical pipelines: WGS, <a href="http://github.com/joshuashen/ExomePipe">exome</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine</h2>

<p><em>Drug adverse reactions</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Contribution of common variants and rare variants</li>
<li>Clinical utility: risk prediction and personalized prescription. </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Related phenotypes</em></p>

<ul>
<li>DILI and autoimmune; DILI due to different drugs</li>
<li>SJS/TEN and hypersensitivity; SJS due to different drugs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Statistical genetics</h2>

<p><em>Pleiotropy</em>:  Pleiotropy in autoimmune disease is related to common aetiologies. An example of this is the clustering of other autoimmune diseases in the parents of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), which may indicate an underlying common genetic susceptibility. This may be due to the involvement of common autoimmune loci such as the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC), but clustering of linked loci in non-MHC regions (such as PTPN22 gene) has also been observed in a wide range of autoimmune diseases.</p>

<p><em>Compound heterozygosity</em>: a special version of gene-gene interaction. Detection methods and power</p>

<p><em>Scoring of variants</em>: Bayesian scoring of variants by combining annotation, eQTL priors, and conservation, and combining across variants.</p>

<h2>Medical sequencing</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mendelian may help to reveals crucial components of the disease process</li>
<li>Whole genome resequencing of a handful of patients has the potential to reveal the genetics of rare diseases. </li>
</ul>

<p>Linkage analysis is good for most single-gene high penetrance Mendelian diseases, but sequencing will help to find the genes for other Mendelians:</p>
<ul>
<li>with lower penetrance, or locus heterogeneity without collecting large pedigrees. </li>
<li>quicker than family-based linkage.</li>
</ul>
